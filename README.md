# svg-currentcolor-converter
A Python script that optimizes SVG files for React applications by replacing fill and stroke attributes with currentColor. This allows you to dynamically change SVG colors directly from React components. The script also renames files for better readability and batch-processes multiple SVGs at once. ðŸš€
